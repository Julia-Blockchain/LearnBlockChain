# Learn BlockChain with Julia 

## Project Type

Simulation/Analysis/Learning Resources using Julia (might do this through the lens of an ICO since that would get folks interested, but still TBD till I learn more in lecture)

## Main Project Idea

Build a well designed set of materials so people can learn the basics of blockchain with Julia. The motivation for this is that personally, I feel like I am still shaky on the fundmentals of Blockchain and I hope that this process will help me solidify my understanding. 

I plan to build out some basic simulations along with video demos to help folks learn the basics of blockchain. Part of my idea is to also shed light on some painpoints for blockchain development with Julia if any come up. 

## Potential Market

I think there is a growing Julia community who would love to see an analysis and some intro materials on Blockchain in Julia. I may uncover that the language is not well suited for this development which in that case I will share the findings. 

## Workflow

I will be using the Julia programming language. I plan to leverage: https://github.com/lambda-mechanics/Web3.jl and some other basic Julia Blockchain packages to build out basic blockchain examples. 

## Last Mile

I do not believe this applies in my case. 

## Scale

Given the nature of building intro materials using the existing Julia blockchain materials, I don't think this will come into play. 

## Fraud 

Julia has shared global states which can allow for fraud. I intent to look into this in my materials/analysis but am not a language design expert so may not get a good analysis of this part. 

## My idea without the Blockchain 

Not applicable.
